## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the key things I practiced in this challenge was centering a div using `display: flex` and utilizing `object-fit: cover` for the profile image. Hereâ€™s an example:

```css
.profile-picture img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```

This ensures the image fits nicely within the circular frame without distortion.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:
- Improving accessibility for screen readers.
- Enhancing responsiveness using CSS Grid and Flexbox together.
- Using CSS animations for better user experience.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand flexbox better and apply it efficiently.
- [MDN Web Docs - Object Fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - Helped me ensure images are properly fitted inside their containers.
